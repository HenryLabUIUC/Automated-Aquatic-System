# Automated Aquatic System
This projects includes the Arduino sketches, Fritzing diagrams, list of parts and suppliers, and various 3D printer .stl files
to build the feeding controller, and dimensioned diagrams for various parts used in the automated marine aquatic system to 
rear Crepidula snails and other marine organisms. These files are labled and named as "Supplemental File #" according to the 
way they are referenced in the manuscript: Henry et al., 2020 (submitted for publication). This project is supported by an NSF 
EDGE grant (no. 1827533) to J.J. Henry. See www.life.illinois.edu/henry/tools.html

This projects includes the Arduino sketches, Fritzing diagrams, list of parts and suppliers, and various 3D printer .stl files
to build the feeding controller for the automated marine aquatic system used to rear Crepidula snails and other marine 
organisms. The files are labled and named as "Supplemental File #" according to the way they are referenced in the manuscript: 
Henry et al., 2020 (submitted for publication). This project is supported by an NSF EDGE grant (no. 1827533) to J.J. Henry.

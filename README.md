# Automated Aquatic System
This projects includes the Arduino sketches, Fritzing diagrams, list of parts and suppliers, and various 3D printer .stl files
to build the feeding controller, and its associated peristaltic pump controller, to rear Crepidula snails and other marine
organisms. In addition there are some dimensioned diagrams for various parts used in the automated marine aquatic system
These files are labled and named as "Supplemental File #" according to the way they are referenced in the manuscript: Henry,
Lesoway and Perry, 2020, and Supplemental File 1, the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in (BMC Biology). This
project is supported by an NSF EDGE grant (no. 1827533) to J.J. Henry (J.Q.H.). See www.life.illinois.edu/henry/tools.html
